                You may choose to interact with our Apps in ways that provide us
                with your personal information. In some instances, a User ID is
                generated for form and URL tracking, page views, page pings and
                usage counts in order to ascertain product performance and
                development. The amount and type of information that VibeStudio
                gathers depends on the nature of your interaction with us, as
                well as the amount of information you choose to share. For
                example, we ask visitors who use our community Discord, or our
                forum, to provide a username and email address. We will also
                collect the information you provide with us in connection with
                creating an account on the App. In each case, VibeStudio
                collects such personal information only insofar as is necessary
                or appropriate to fulfill the purpose of your interaction with
                or your request to VibeStudio. We will not disclose your

                Like most website operators, VibeStudio automatically collects
                (i) technical information about your device including your
                device&apos;s internet protocol (IP) address, device type (e.g.,

                for advertising purposes), language settings, mobile device
                carrier, radio/network information (e.g., WiFi, LTE, 4G), and
                general location information such as city, state or geographic
                area; and (ii) information about your visit to our Apps and
                online activity data (such as the referral URL, the content
                viewed and the content interacted with). Some of this
                information is collected using cookies, web beacons and related
                local storage technologies. See below for further information on
                these technologies. We collect this information to better

                If you are a registered user of the Apps and have supplied your

                tell you about security, system information, new features,
                solicit your feedback, or just keep you up to date with

                primarily use our blog to communicate this type of information,

                VibeStudio will retain your information for as long as your
                account is active or as needed to perform our contractual
                obligations, provide you services through the App, to comply
                with legal obligations, resolve disputes, preserve legal rights,
                or enforce our agreements. Retention periods will be determined
                taking into account the type of information that is collected
                and the purpose for which it is collected, bearing in mind the
                requirements applicable to the situation and the need to destroy
                outdated, unused information at the earliest reasonable
                opportunity. For instance, in respect of data held for the
                management of customers and potential customers, we consider the
                lead time necessary to develop and maintain our commercial
                relationships and how recent our interactions are with you. We
                may rectify, update or remove incomplete or inaccurate
                information, at any time and at our own discretion. For more
                information on our retention periods you can contact us using

                Please note that due to the open source nature of our products,
                services, and community, we may retain limited personal
                information indefinitely in order to ensure transactional
                integrity and nonrepudiation. For example, if you provide your
                information in connection with a blog post, GitHub issue or
                comment, we may display that information even if you have
                deleted your account as we do not automatically delete community
                posts.
